# Hotel listing and rating site

For local and international travelers looking to explore Ethiopia and stay in good places, we are building a hotel listing and rating site that helps them discover and learn about hotels across Ethiopia.

Currently, there is no centralized local platform that lists and books hotels across Ethiopia and helps travelers find a good place to stay and places to visit. 

By building a hotel listing and rating site, we will empower hospitality businesses to list and promote their hotels and services online and help tourists make informed decisions.

The platform will feature hotel listings, user reviews and ratings, environmental guides, and more.

Unlike existing solutions, our platform will focus on promoting hospitality services across Ethiopia and improving the overall travel experience for both local and international tourists and travelers.

Problem:
- No local centralized platform for hotel listing and booking across Ethiopia.
- Lack of accessible and structured information for travelers.
- Limited digital tools(websites) for hotel businesses.

Goal:
